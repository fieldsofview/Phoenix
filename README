This is a new project based on the "Gestalt" project which I forked earlier from its SourceForge site. The project is intended to be a completely new agent platform with a whole new architecture for speed and compactness. Some of the concepts to be used for the development is derived from the experiece we have had from developing hairy (yes, HAIRY) agent simulations. Though some code can be seen to be similar (or same), this will eventually be CLEANED out. This project is still not functional.
