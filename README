This is a new project based on the "Gestalt" project which I forked earlier from its SourceForge site. The project is inteded to be a completely new platfrom with a whole new architecture and a fater and smaller code base. Some the concepts to be used is also from the experiece we have gained from developing hairy (yes, hairy) agent simulations. Though some code can be seen to be similar this will eventually CLEANED out. This project is still not functional.
