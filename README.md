which will be done as we develop our projects around it. Please refer to the 
Wiki for detailed explanation of the design, installation, license, etc,.

* This is a platform for agent-based modelling and has been designed for speed, 
scalability and extensibility.
* This project was initially a fork from "Gestalt" on SourceForge, but has 
replaced almost all of the code.
* Experience in developing "Gestalt" has helped define the specifications for 
this platform.

The project has undergone major architectural changes. We will update the wiki 
for the project soon to explain these changes. The changes are big enough for 
it to have its own branch. Branch NMH(New Modern Hotel) is created as the next 
branch.

Another major update.NMH is planned to be merged into the master branch. The 
wiki is updated. Phoenix now builds without errors. Please refer to the wiki 
pages for installation and information on Phoenix architecture. Refer to the 
TODO file for upcoming changes.

NMH is complete. Phoenix core has been fixed to run individual systems with
multiple agents. A set of initial tests are successful. After the final pull
request a new branch is being created called "MTR". MTR will include
a full agent-to-agent communication system along with minimal capability for 
recording and displaying statistical output. Updating documentation and 
additional packages to run automated tests are also planned for release to 
help adding new features and testing.
